INITIAL SPRINT
- build main screen DONE
- serve main screen to client DONE
- hyperlink a few bits of it to navigate to next screens
- build next screen

- database is AFTER initial sprint

CURRENT STATE AT END OF 4/1:

app runs and serves a functional html
HTML has an image, a series of buttons and a table
That table is getting data via an API, which is getting data from a sqlite table

Next steps: 
Build out SQLITE database
    build another endpoint, devmode. just little by little based on 
    what you need to do over and over again
Build other tables from notes
Build foreign keys and whatnot into it
Build dev tools into the UI
    add new user
    add new request type
    add new due date due_date_reason
Then I can make my "submit new request" button

Once i get a new request to show up: DONT FORGET TO commit
add a login screen that just makes you enter a username and a password
    MAKE A SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT MODULE FOR AUTH


Then we can start talking about adding equipment
