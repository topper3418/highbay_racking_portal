possibly genius idea???


create a class to represent a generic column in a database. 
make a subclass for each type of column (theres only like four I think)
give each column something like a default value for each default value, 
give it the ability to generate the ddl line
also give it the ability to generate a default read line
Make it so when added to a custom "table" class, when the table says 
    "ddl", it organizes the rows properly
you can add foreign keys after the fact, and the tables will arrange 
    themselves according to dependency using the __gt__ dunder methods
you can then feed these table objects into some overlord database object 
    and it executes the master ddl
you can point the tables to csv files to add sample data
